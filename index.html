                    Welcome friend🤭
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">My name is <b>Oluwafemi Victoria.</b></p>

                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Here is a little story about me✨.</p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">It has to do with what inspired my journey to where I am
                    today. It is very personal and emotional. Each time I remember the past few years of my life, I
                    break
                    down in tears because I never believed I could come out in one piece.</p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">I hope my story will inspire you in any way. ✨</p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Early this year, I became completely broke. I literally
                    didn't have any money. I always imagined how people without money survived. It was a difficult
                    period
                    for me. I had never experienced anything close to this kind of "brokeness". I became depressed, I
                    was
                    always overthinking, full of anxiety. I became a very frustrated young lady.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Why? I just lost my life savings to a ponzi investment.💔
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">When I say life savings, I mean life savings. My dad had
                    always taught me the idea of saving money. He'd always say, "whether or not you need the money, just
                    save; you will meet it in the future and you will be thankful".
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">I tried it when I was in JSS 2. I had saved all the money
                    gifted to me by uncles, cousins, dad's friends, mom's friends, etc. I even went ahead to save dad
                    and
                    mom's balance when they send me on an errand and they forget to ask for the "change". LoL... don't
                    judge
                    me o.</p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">By December, when I broke my piggy, I was like OMG! I
                    couldn't believe my eyes. I had a lot of money. I showed it to my dad he was really impressed. That
                    year, I borrowed my mom up to 20k (even though she hasn't returned in full till today...talmabout
                    have I
                    not been eating in the house) which didn't affect all the cloth and other Christmas spending I did
                    for
                    myself. It was really fulfilling and rewarding. Ever since then I've never gone soft on saving.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">By the end of 100l, relatives stopped giving me money but
                    I
                    didn't feel it because I have enough savings. At a point, I noticed I was only spending and nothing
                    was
                    bringing in money. That's how I ventured into petty trading (buy and resell)
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">This made a lot of sense, I was making mad money. I did
                    this
                    for more than 2 years. I was already counting my own money, spending like no man's business.
                    In a bid to invest (to make more money), I made the mistake that shattered my life- PONZI!
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Whew like smoke, 450k gone! All my money from bank, piggy
                    (I
                    never dropped the idea), business, heaven, earth... everything gone.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">This was entirely the savings I've gathered from the
                    petty
                    job I was doing and also my monthly allowance from home.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Losing this money was as if I've lost my life😕
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">"Where will I start from?" I asked myself🙆🏾‍♂️
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">I needed to pay my school fees and needed to settle other
                    things required by the school because I stopped asking for money at home. They only pay my school
                    feels
                    and gave me allowance once in a while to remind me they are still my parents.😀
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">I couldn't talk to my parent because they've sent me the
                    money but I used it for this investment and now all is gone😭
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">The only thing that came through my mind that spot was to
                    end
                    it all. I didn't know how to live 💔
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Before I say my final goodbyes I decided to source for a
                    solution from the internet. I never believed in all these things. But as things were then, situation
                    had
                    warranted me to go on the internet to lift myself back up financially.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">So, I decided to try out some of the various money making
                    online programs that I have been seeing around. Most of them had everlasting process to follow. It
                    would
                    take more than 8months for some to materialize into money. It looked like forever to me even though
                    I am
                    a hardworking girl and I was ready to put in the work.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">I decided to start networking but that didn't end as
                    planned.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">At this point, it was a though the whole world was a
                    against
                    me. I was losing my mind.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">What I experienced wasn't funny at all. It was
                    unbearable.😩
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">So, I tried other programs again and again but they are
                    all
                    the same.
                </p>
                <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Finally, after several disappointments, I gave up and by
                    this
                    time, I had already spent all my money and was back to square one.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">Fast forward to February 2022, I was still looking for a way
                out
                when I came across Affiliate Marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">At this time, my energy was already low but I had told myself
                I
                wouldn't give up since I wasn't going to commit suicide again. Like play like play o, I started earning.
                I
                was particularly surprised because it was a lot of money by just simply promoting Digital products
                online
                under a mentors’ mentorship.
            </p>
            <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider">First month, I accumulated up to 160K. What!? Is this
                playing? I
                was Shocked😲
            </p>
            <p class="py-5 leading-relaxed tracking-wider"> This is the proof of my 160k alert✨</p>

                myself. I showed my mentor. He saw the excitement in me then he told me that it's even possible for me
                to
                earn more. That got me fired up. ✨
